# myportfolio
This is my portfolio. I officially released it on 3rd March, 2021. I've been working on it for a while but haven't finished since due to exams and school activities. I'm  really proud of my work and hope to improve on it as time goes on. I hope to learn more things like javascript, bootstrap and react.

update as at April 28th 2022
Haven't done any webdev for over a year now. Recently started JS; pretty nice. Will update portfolio sooner or later
